# WASM example

Examples use a CLI tool named `wasm-pack` to build this example:

```
cargo install wasm-pack --version 0.9.1
```

(wasm-pack should be available if you used `nix-shell` in the root directory)

## Building

To build the example, run:

```
wasm-pack build --target web
```

## Running

(simple-http-server is available via `nix-shell` in the root directory)
